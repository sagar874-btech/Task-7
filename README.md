# Task-7
The objective of this task is to implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification using both linear and non-linear kernels. The process begins with loading and preparing a relevant dataset—such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset—by performing data cleaning, encoding categorical labels, and feature scaling. The task involves training SVM models using both linear and RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernels to compare their classification performance. A key requirement is to visualize the decision boundary in two dimensions by reducing the feature space using PCA. Additionally, the task includes tuning important hyperparameters like C and gamma using cross-validation techniques to optimize the model’s performance. The final goal is to evaluate and interpret the accuracy and robustness of the models using performance metrics and visualization.
